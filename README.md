# MoodLens

MoodLens is an innovative web application that leverages the power of AWS Rekognition to analyze and interpret users' emotions through their photos. It detects a range of moods by examining facial expressions in user-uploaded images, providing instant mood insights in a fun and interactive way.

## How It Works

Users simply upload a photo, and MoodLens does the rest. Using advanced image recognition technology, the app examines facial features and expressions to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, and more, offering a unique glimpse into the user's emotional state.
